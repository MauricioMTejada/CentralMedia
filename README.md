# CentralMedia

CentralMedia has been developed using Next.js, Tailwind, and TypeScript. At its core, this project aims to present a list of radio stations from my city. However, unlike RadioBrowser, the main functionality is based on a centralized playback control.

To achieve this, I utilized the utility of the "react-h5-audio-player" library for the visualization and control of audio playback for each radio station; a library I used in the previous project.

In addition to audio playback, the CentralMedia project is designed to be compatible with video streaming sources. Although this feature is still in development and has not been fully implemented.

### Installation:

1. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

### Usage:

2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
